# TMU Courses API

A comprehensive dataset and API for Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU) programs and courses.

---

## üß≠ Overview

This project provides:

- **A public REST API server** hosted at [https://tmu-courses-api.onrender.com](https://tmu-courses-api.onrender.com) to fetch TMU programs and course data.  
- **An NPM package** (`tmu-courses-api`) for local, offline access to the same data in any Node.js project ‚Äî no internet required.

| `/programs/:program`   | Get all courses in a program       | GET https://tmu-courses-api.onrender.com/programs/Computer Science              |
| `/course/:code`        | Get course details by course code  | GET https://tmu-courses-api.onrender.com/course/CPS 109                         |

#### üí° Example Usage (via curl)

    # Get all programs
    curl https://tmu-courses-api.onrender.com/programs

    # Get courses for a specific program
    curl https://tmu-courses-api.onrender.com/programs/Accounting

    # Get specific course details
    curl https://tmu-courses-api.onrender.com/course/ACC 100

### üì¶ Using the NPM Package

Install the package in your Node.js project:

```bash
npm install tmu-courses-api
```

Then use it in your code:

```js
const tmuCourses = require('tmu-courses-api');

// üîπ Get all program names
console.log(tmuCourses.getPrograms());

// üîπ Get all courses in a specific program
console.log(tmuCourses.getCourses("Computer Science"));

```
